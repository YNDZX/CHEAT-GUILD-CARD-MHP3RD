# CHEATGUILDCARDMHP3RD
Repo For Cheat Gc Mhp3rd
Requirements:
 - PPSSPP 1.10.3 Or Latter
 - Mhp3rd English Patch V5 Hd Version

Note: Code Cannot Be Used On Mhp3rd Non Hd

How To Install:
 
- Move the Cheat Code to the Psp/Cheat Directory Paste it there
- First Edit the Code Before Use
- Where QQQQ = Number Of Quests Cleared
- where WWWW = number of times edit: didn't noticed earlier, but basically those times used weapon codes are only for quests, I completely forgot about training having other statistic for this :3.
- HHHH = number of times hunted
CCCC = number of times captured
MAXS = maximum size in %
MINS = minimum size in %
Few monsters can only be hunted, that's why they have only 1 line of code, you can also remove lines you don't want to change for any other monster.

Here are some screenshots of some of the progress so far:
